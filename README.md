# PerceptionAutoLabeling

## Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of modern computer vision models when trained exclusively on synthetic datasets generated using Unity's Perception package.

## Methodology
The foundation of this project follows Unity's comprehensive tutorial for synthetic data generation:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.perception@1.0/manual/Tutorial/Phase1.html

## Custom 3D Asset Creation
To create a unique test case, I 3D scanned a wooden cobra sculpture using a high-resolution Creality Raptor 3D scanner, capturing intricate details for realistic synthetic training data.

## Dataset Generation
The scanned cobra model was integrated into Unity scenes to automatically generate a comprehensive dataset of 10,000 synthetic images with varied lighting, backgrounds, and camera angles.
